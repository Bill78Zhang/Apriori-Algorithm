#csci-59000-big-data-analytics

This project is implementation of Apriori Algorithm to find frequent item sets in a data set.
My implementation of the algorithm is done in Python 2.7.3. I have used some standard libraries to import and working with large data files making it lot easier. 
I have completely found frequent data sets and close, maximum data sets from the frequent item sets. 

Various inputs required for running.
I have implemented file naming to get user input as file name in (.dat) format files.
Then it would ask for Minimum Support required to calculate the frequent item sets from the database file.

Steps to run the file:-
1. Open the terminal (Tesla or Karst)
2. Follow to the directory of the file.
3. run - python apriori.py
4. Results will be displayed on the terminal.

Thank You
